## Our Partners.

- We were partnered with the Center for Social Research here at Calvin.
- They conduct social-scientific research projects, by taking data from collections to reporting.

## Where we got our data.

- We got our data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive.
- We wanted to look at the discharges that happened during 2017 in Michigan only.
- We were given a codebook about variables.

# <span style="color:white">What variables predict whether a person entering treatment uses opioids or not?</span>

## Model #1 -- Use of Opioids

opiModel <- glmmTMB (OPIFLG ~ GENDER + MARSTAT + GENDER\*MARSTAT + GENDER\*EMPLOY + LIVARAG + LIVARAG\*EDUC + 
                  LIVARAG*EMPLOY + NOPRIOR + FREQ_ATND_SELF_HELP + (1|rowgroups), 
                  family=binomial(link="logit"), data=tedsd_MI2017_notna)
                  

# <span style="color:white">What variables predict whether a person entering treatment uses more than one kind of opioid?</span>


## Model #2 -- More than 1 Type of Opioid

multiOpiModel <- glmmTMB(MULTIOPI ~ HERFLG + METHFLG + OPSYNFLG + AGE + GENDER + MARSTAT +
                      EDUC + EDUC\*LIVARAG + EDUC\*NOPRIOR + EMPLOY+ LIVARAG + ARRESTS +
                      NOPRIOR + FREQ_ATND_SELF_HELP + (1|rowgroups), data = tedsd_MI2017_opi,
                     family = binomial(link = "logit"))


# <span style="color:white"> What variables predict the length of stay for a person who enters treatment for opioid use?</span>


## Model #3 -- Length of Stay

los_lrm <- glmmTMB(LONGSTAY ~ AGE + EDUC + EMPLOY + FREQ_ATND_SELF_HELP + PSOURCE + OPSYNFLG + (1|rowgroups), data=tedsd_MI2017_los, family=binomial(link = "logit"))

## Challenges

- ACFs
- Choosing predictors
- VIFs
